                        <h2>Who we are..</h2>
                        <p>We are a small organisation that has been carrying out site assessments since 2001. We have recently been placed on a select list of approved site assessors to carry out site suitability assessments for on-site wastewater treatment.</p>
                        <p>Our qualified assessor has completed the FAS/EPA Site Suitability Assessment For On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems course (FETAC) and holds certificates in Construction Studies, Civil Engineering, and Building Energy Assessment (BER). We are Associate Members of Engineers Ireland (AMIEI) and the Irish Onsite Wastewater Association (IOWA).</p>

                        <h2>What we do..</h2>
                        <p>Our service includes a site visit with your agent to advise on the best location to place the percolation area. This is particularly important if your site shows obvious signs of impaired drainage such as rush growth, water logging or excessive poaching by stock.</p>
                        <p>We provide a site layout (1:500 scale) showing the percolation facility most suited for your site, including site levels, nearby surface drains, adjacent dwellings, and proposed wastewater system locations. We carry out site assessments in accordance with the EPA Code of Practice 2009, which involves significant changes from previous guidelines.</p>
                        <p>We are entirely independent of any wastewater treatment system manufacturer and recommend the system which is most suitable to your site, advising on the economics of available options.</p>

                        <h2>Who needs a Site Assessment ?</h2>
                        <p>Since Wednesday 14th July 2010, all site assessors have been instructed to carry out site assessments in accordance with the new EPA Code of Practice 2009. Planning applicants for single dwellings now require professional site assessments to demonstrate that their proposed wastewater treatment will not endanger public health.</p>
                        <p>If a site shows obvious signs of impaired drainage, such as rush growth, water logging, unsuitable soils, shallow soil depths or insufficient land area, site improvement works will be required. A site assessment that only provides opinions and recommendations in cases where sites clearly have hydraulic issues may invite planning refusal because of environmental concerns.</p>
                        <p>We provide complimentary initial site consultations to meet you in person and discuss your proposals regarding dwelling size, land area available, and storm water drainage before providing a detailed quotation.</p>
